March 18, 2019. First version of scipion-pkpd plugin

May, 2019. Numerical Non-compartmental Analysis added
       This analysis does not require any fitting and it is only valid if
           the concentration observations go to zero in the long term (for instance,
           in an impulse response)
May, 2019. Dissolution and In-vitro In-vivo correlations module developed:
    - Fitting dissolution models: Weibull, Higuchi, Korsmeyer-Peppas,
                      Hixson-Crowell, Hopfenberg, Hill,
                      Splines2-10
    - Deconvolution of the dissolution from in vivo experiments
    - Bootstrapping of dissolution models
    - Similarity between two sets of dissolution profiles (reference and test, F1 and F2)
    - Calculation of the Levy plot
    - In vitro-In vivo correlations
    - Simulation of In vivo response using a dissolution profile and an IVIVC profile
    - Verification of the internal validity of an IVIVC

 June 2019. Small changes:
 	- The simulation of PK models now keep Cmax, Cmin, Cavg, Tmax, and Tmin
